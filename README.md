# Penguins-Classification

Created a Penguins Classification Web App that predicts the Palmer Penguin species using Machine Learning model - Random Forest Classifier. User can choose to manually adjust the input of the features (Island, Sex, Bill Length, Bill Depth, Flipper Length & Body Mass) or upload a csv file in the correct format. Based on user input, this app predicts the Palmer Penguin species ("Adelie":0, "Chinstrap":1, "Gentoo":2) and also displays the probability of each target.
